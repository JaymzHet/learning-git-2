    <h1>Aerosmith - Dream on</h1>
    <p>Every time I look in the mirror
       All these lines on my face getting clearer
       The past is gone
       It went by like dusk to dawn
       Isn't that the way
       Everybody's got their dues in life to pay.
    </p>
    <p>Yeah, I know nobody knows
       Where it comes and where it goes
       I know it's everybody's sin
       You got to lose to know how to win.
    </p>
    <p>
       Half my life's in books' written pages
       Live and learn from fools and from sages
       You know it's true
       All the things come back to you
    </p>
